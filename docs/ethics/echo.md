# Section 1 — Frozen Principles (Cannot Regress)

These are guardrails. If any one breaks, the product is no longer itself.

* User privacy is never compromised for growth.
* Nothing private becomes public by default.
* Silence, inactivity, and absence are valid states.
* The product never shames, ranks, pressures, or coerces.
* Users always control when reflection appears.
* No content is auto-surfaced for engagement.
* We design for nervous systems, not addiction.
* Calm is a feature, not a side effect.
* These principles are non-negotiable.

# Section 2 — What We Will Never Add

This section removes ambiguity and protects the product from future temptation, trends, fear, or investor pressure.

We will never add:

* Streaks, daily pressure mechanics, or attendance tracking.
* Public leaderboards, rankings, or comparison charts.
* Engagement-based punishment or decay.
* “You should post more” nudges or guilt-based reminders.
* Comparative analytics between users.
* Social pressure disguised as motivation.
* Dark patterns, urgency language, or artificial scarcity.
* Metrics that turn reflection into performance.

If a feature requires pressure to work, it does not belong here.
