# Copy Safety Checklist — Reflection & Echo System

This document is the canonical safety checklist for all text related to:
- reflections
- echoes
- prompts
- reminders
- empty states

Its purpose is to protect psychological dignity and avoid coercive or addictive framing.

Before shipping ANY copy, review every line against this checklist.

## 🚫 Forbidden Language (never allowed)

Copy must NOT include or imply:

- urgency language
- countdowns or expiring timers
- streaks or continuity pressure
- “don’t lose your progress”
- “come back”
- “you haven’t reflected in a while”
- guilt or shame framing
- leaderboard or score framing
- comparison to other users
- “others are ahead”
- ranking or status language
- progress as morality or worth
- pressure to return or keep writing

Words and phrases that are **banned outright**:

- streak
- leaderboard
- rank
- hurry
- urgent
- don’t lose progress
- come back
- keep up
- falling behind
- earn
- achievement
- score
- boost

If any of these appear, the copy **fails** immediately.

## ✅ Required Tone (must follow all)

All copy in this system must be:

- optional
- calm
- neutral
- invitational
- non-pushy
- non-judgmental
- non-therapeutic promise making
- non-evaluative

Allowed examples:

- “You can write if you want to.”
- “This is just for you.”
- “You can stop anytime.”

Not allowed:

- “You should…”
- “You need to…”
- “It’s important that you return…”

## 🔕 Silence Handling Policy

Silence is treated as:

- valid completion
- chosen privacy
- rest
- neutral state
- not a failure

Silence must NOT be interpreted as:

- mistake
- neglect
- avoidance
- lack of commitment
- something to fix

Copy must NOT:

- ask why the user didn’t write
- nudge them to return
- imply missing data
- imply something went wrong

Acceptable empty experience:

- calm empty space
- soft optional affordance
- or nothing at all

---

## 🕊️ Grief & Vulnerability Test

For every message, ask:

> Would this still feel gentle if the reader were grieving?

If the answer is anything other than **yes**, the copy fails.

No exceptions.

---

## 🧠 Autonomy & Agency Protection

Copy must clearly respect that:

- Echo never auto-surfaces
- Reveal is always user-controlled
- Hiding is always available
- Writing is optional
- No one is watching or comparing
- No metric of “doing well” exists

---

## 🛑 If uncertain — default to silence

If you are unsure whether text is safe:

- remove it
- silence is safer than pressure
- the system must function without copy
