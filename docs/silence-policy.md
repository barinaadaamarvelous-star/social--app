# Silence Policy — Canonical UX Rule

Silence is valid.

Silence is treated as:
- complete data
- emotionally neutral
- a legitimate user choice
- not a problem to solve

Silence does NOT mean:
- abandonment
- disengagement
- failure
- non-compliance
- lack of care
- something “wrong” with the user

System behavior during silence:

- no reminders
- no escalations
- no pressure
- no comeback letters
- no guilt language
- no “empty state drama”
- no “we miss you”
- no timers or streaks
- no leaderboards
- no comparison to others

UI behavior during silence:

- allowed to render nothing
- may show soft affordance (optional open state)
- no red badges
- no urgency colors
- no “why didn’t you…” wording

Engineering principle:

- silence is stored as absence or empty content
- silence is NOT stored as a boolean flag
- silence does NOT require explanation
- silence must never be inferred into meaning
