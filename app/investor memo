Good.
This is the right moment to do this.

What follows is the full pressure-test copy — not slides, not theory — the exact language you would use to defend $12 at 100k users without breaking the nervous-system contract of the product.

You can paste this into:

an internal doc

an investor memo

your own design spine

Pressure Test: $12 at Scale
What is being sold

We do not sell:

motivation

productivity

self-improvement

insight

growth

We sell relief from cognitive holding.

A synthesis is a memory container.
It exists so the user does not have to keep carrying a period of thought.

Payment is not for access.
Payment is for permission to stop remembering.

Why $12 (not $5, not $29)

$12 is deliberately:

too small to feel like a financial decision

too large to impulse-buy repeatedly

non-round so it resists bundling psychology

$12 sits below:

therapy framing

subscription framing

productivity pricing

And above:

novelty pricing

content pricing

tip-jar psychology

It is the price of quiet ownership, not consumption.

Why $12 still works at 100k users

At 100k users:

most users will buy 0–2 syntheses per year

a small subset will buy 3–6

nobody buys them weekly

This is intentional.

The system does not reward frequency.
It rewards closure.

Revenue scales via:

time, not usage

life events, not streaks

return, not engagement

That makes the revenue curve:

slower

steadier

far less extractive

VC Pressure: “Why not subscriptions?”

Subscriptions require:

perceived loss on cancel

ongoing justification

feature inflation

engagement hooks

This product cannot survive those incentives.

A subscription would force:

reminders

prompts

urgency

content padding

Which would destroy:

bodily relief

return trust

silence as value

We choose unit economics over ARPU inflation.

Growth Pressure: “How do you scale without dark patterns?”

We scale via:

retention by safety

return by trust

word-of-mouth via relief

Users recommend this product not by saying:

“It made me better”

But by saying:

“It didn’t ask anything from me.”

That kind of recommendation scales slower, but longer.

Bad Actor Pressure: “Won’t people game it?”

There is nothing to game.

No:

streaks

limits

scores

unlock ladders

A synthesis either:

exists

or does not

Payment only changes whether it persists.

There is no leverage surface.

Internal Temptation: “Couldn’t we add…”

Every future feature must pass this test:

Does this reduce what the user must hold?

If it:

increases interaction

increases explanation

increases anticipation

It fails.

We do not add features.
We add containers.

Refunds & Regret Safety

We expect regret to be:

rare

quiet

private

Policy:

refunds honored without friction

no retention tactics post-purchase

no reminder of “value missed”

If someone regrets buying, the system has already failed.

Why this survives at scale

Because:

the product does not chase growth

the pricing does not chase LTV

the system does not compete for attention

It earns:

return without reminders

payment without pressure

trust without explanation

At scale, restraint is the moat.

Final line (the one that matters)

We don’t monetize thinking.
We monetize not having to think anymore
