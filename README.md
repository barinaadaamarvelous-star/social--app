## 🧭 Frozen Principles Index
## 📜 Frozen Contracts Index

This index lists contracts that define meaning.
They are not suggestions. They are binding.

If a contract appears here, it is frozen.

### Frozen Contracts

1. Prompt–Echo Pairing Rules — Design Contract
   - Defines the meaning of the reflection echo system
   - Behavior must conform to this contract
   - Code may implement, but may not reinterpret

(Any future contracts must be added explicitly.)


> This index exists to prevent silent drift.  
> If something is listed here, it is intentionally frozen.

These are not features. They are guarantees.

- Echo never auto-surfaces
- Echo reveals only on explicit user action
- Echo can always be hidden again
- No urgency language around reflection
- Echo must never compare the user to others
- No rankings, leaderboards, or relational metrics
- Reflection is private and not a performance
- Silence is always a valid state
- Reflection is never used for pressure mechanics

Changes to these must be explicit, deliberate, and documented.  
Accidental drift is not allowed.

## Frozen Principles — Prompt–Echo System

> This section is normative.  
> It defines what must remain true for this system to be itself.

### Design Authority

The **meaning** of the Prompt–Echo system is defined in:

**Prompt–Echo Pairing Rules — Design Contract**

Code exists only to enforce those boundaries.  
If implementation conflicts with the design contract:

> **the code is wrong**

---

### Non-Negotiable Guarantees

The Prompt–Echo system must always satisfy the following:

- Echoes are never auto-surfaced  
- Echoes are collapsed by default  
- Reveal and hide are entirely user-controlled  
- Silence, inactivity, and absence are valid states  
- No urgency language is permitted  
- No comparison or ranking framing is permitted  
- Reflection is private and not a performance  

This system must feel **optional, calm, and ignorable**.

---

### What This System Is Not

The Prompt–Echo system is **not**:

- a growth mechanism  
- a retention tool  
- a habit-forming loop  
- a motivational engine  
- a self-improvement tracker  
- a comparative analytics surface  

If engagement increases, that is incidental.  
Metrics do not justify change.

---

### Sources of Authority (ordered)

When intent and implementation conflict, resolve in this order:

1. README — Frozen Principles  
2. Design Contracts (human-readable)  
3. Database constraints & RLS policies  
4. Tests  
5. Implementation code  

No lower layer may redefine the intent of a higher layer.

---

### Change Discipline

- Frozen principles do not drift  
- Wording changes are semantic changes  
- “Small tweaks” are still changes  
- Convenience is not justification  

To change anything frozen:

- update this index  
- update the frozen section  
- record why the change exists  

---

### Why This Exists

Public metrics shape behavior.  
Private reflection shapes identity.

These must never mix.

This system exists to support psychological trust —  
not pressure, performance, or optimization.

---

### Freeze Clause

This section is frozen.

If changing it feels tempting,  
that is a signal to stop — not proceed.

---
Echo must never pressure the user.
No urgency framing, countdowns, streaks, or loss aversion.
Reflection is voluntary and never rushed.

Echo must never compare the user to others.
No rankings, leaderboards, or relational metrics.
Reflection is private and not a performance.
